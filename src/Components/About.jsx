        <strong>
          I have had the opportunity to work in a diverse range of career
          fields: Automotive Mechanics, Construction, the Hollywood Industry,
          and now as a Software Developer. My journey began in the automotive
          field as a mechanic, where I developed a strong foundation in
          problem-solving and engineering. I then transitioned to construction,
          which further honed my skills in teamwork and project management. My
          experience in the Hollywood industry allowed me to manage high-profile
          projects like "American Horror Story" seasons 7 and 8, which were
          filmed at Fox Studios, I was named Location Foreman/Manager,
          responsible for ensuring all logistical needs were met and
          collaborating with creative teams working on the pilot for "9-1-1"
          which than became seasons 1 and 2, which involved extensive location
          work due to its focus on emergency calls and first responders, also
          filmed at Fox Studios, and "This Is Us," filmed at Paramount Studios.
          I also had the opportunity to work at Disney Studios and Warner
          Brothers lot and more. My passion for creating and designing new
          things, combined with my ability to work effectively on a team, has
          always driven me. This passion eventually led me to software
          development, where I now specialize as a Full Stack Web Developer with
          JavaScript and the MERN stack. I am also branching out to other stacks
          and tools, constantly expanding my knowledge and skills. I am a very
          hands-on learner and greatly enjoy the challenges and opportunities
          that come with working in software development. My family, especially
          my son, is at the heart of everything I do. While I am deeply
          committed to being a great role model for him and ensuring my
          decisions benefit him, I maintain a professional focus at work and
          bring a well-rounded perspective to my projects. Thank you for taking
          the time to learn about me!
